a line of code that contains all image data replacing the image file itself.

 **JAVASCRIPT CLASSES** 
 are blueprints to create many similar objects. 


**JAVASCRIPT**
is a prototype based language.

**CLASSES** 
in javaScript are so called "syntactical sugar".

it's a cleaner and more elegant syntax built over native JavaScript prototype base inheritance, that mimics classes from other programmming languages.

the PUSH method adds one or more elements to the end of the array.

the **FOREACH** method executes a provided function once for each array element.

this value that math.atan2 returns in representing so called theta angle between a given x and y point and positive x axis.
